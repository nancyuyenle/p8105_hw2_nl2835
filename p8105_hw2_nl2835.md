```

### Problem 1:

We import and clean the FiveThirtyEight `pols_month_df` data, which
gives the number of national politicians who are democratic or
republican. Some values of `prez_gop` are `2` - we code them as `gop` in
the new `prez` variable.

``` r

month_df = 
  tibble(
    month_num = 1:12,
    month_abb = month.abb,
    month = month.name
  )

pols_month_df = 
  read_csv(file = "./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") |> 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), convert = TRUE) |> 
  mutate(prez = recode(prez_gop, "0" = "dem", "1" = "gop", "2" = "gop")) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, everything(), -day, -starts_with("prez")) 
```

We import and clean the FiveThirtyEight `SNP_df` data, which gives the
monthly closing values of the S&P 500 by year.

``` r
SNP_df = 
  read_csv(file = "./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") |> 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/", convert = TRUE) |> 
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) |> 
  arrange(year, month) |> 
  select(year, month, close)
```

We clean the `unemployment_df` data to merge with `pols_month_df` and
`SNP_df` datasets.

``` r
unemployment_df = 
  read_csv(file = "./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") |> 
  rename(year = Year) |> 
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month_abb",
    values_to = "unemployment"
  ) |> 
  left_join(x = _,  y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, unemployment)
```

Merging 3 datasets

``` r
fivethirtyeight_data = 
  left_join(pols_month_df, SNP_df) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = unemployment_df)


str(fivethirtyeight_data)
## tibble [822 × 12] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
##  $ year        : num [1:822] 1947 1947 1947 1947 1947 ...
##  $ month       : chr [1:822] "January" "February" "March" "April" ...
##  $ month_num   : int [1:822] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
##  $ gov_gop     : num [1:822] 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 ...
##  $ sen_gop     : num [1:822] 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 ...

### Problem 2:

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("./mr_trashwheel/trashwheel_collection.xlsx", 1,
        range = "A2:N586") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    sheet = "mister trashwheel", homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500) / 
      30) |> 
  select(dumpster, year, month, everything())
```

``` r
proftrashwheel_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("./mr_trashwheel/trashwheel_collection.xlsx", 2,
        range = "A2:M108") |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
  

proftrashwheel_df = proftrashwheel_df |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500) / 30) |> 
  mutate(sheet = "professor trashwheel") |> 
  select(dumpster, year, month, everything())
```

Imported, cleaned, and organized Professor Trash Wheel data.

``` r
gwynnda_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("./mr_trashwheel/trashwheel_collection.xlsx", 4,
        range = "A2:L158") |> 
  mutate(sheet = "gwynnda") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500) / 30) |> 
  select(dumpster, year, month, everything())
```

Imported, cleaned, and organized Gwynnda data.

``` r
proftrashwheel_df <- proftrashwheel_df |>   
    mutate(year = as.numeric(year))


trashwheel_df <- trashwheel_df |>   
    mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

``` r
trashwheel_collection = 
  bind_rows(trashwheel_df, proftrashwheel_df, gwynnda_df) |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

This combined data set has `846` and `r ncol(trashwheel_collection)`
columns. Some key variables are: `dumpster` \#, `date`, `weight_tons`
and `volume_cubic_yards` of trash, and types of trash, including
`plastic_bottles`, `polystyrene`, `cigarette_butts`, `plastic_bags`,
`glass bottles`, `grocery bags`, `chip bags`, and `sports balls`. There
is also a calculation of how many homes would be powered with the amount
of trash in the dumpsters, titled `homes_powered`.

Additionally, the combined dataset includes which `sheet` the data
originated from.

``` r
ptwtons = trashwheel_collection |> 
  filter(sheet=="professor trashwheel") |> 
  pull(weight_tons) |> 
  sum() 
```

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel was
`216.26` tons.

``` r
totalcigsgwyn = trashwheel_collection |> 
  filter(sheet=="gwynnda", year=="2021", month=="July") |> 
  pull(cigarette_butts) |> 
  sum() 
```

The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021
was `1.63\times 10^{4}`.

### Problem 3:

``` r
baseline_df = 
  read_csv("./data_mci/mci_baseline.csv", skip = 1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() 
```

``` r
baseline_df = baseline_df |> 
 mutate(
   sex = ifelse(sex == 1, "male", "female"),
   apoe4 = (apoe4 == "1"),
   )
```

``` r
new_baseline <- baseline_df |> 
  filter(age_at_onset != ".")
```

Important steps in the import process were to skip the first row of the
csv file so that there were not two rows of variable names. Names were
cleaned to be usable in R, and sex and APOE4 carrier status were changed
to a male/female character variable and a logical variable,
respectively.

There were `483` participants recruited, and of these, `97` developed
MCI.

The average baseline age for participants in the study is `65.6113402`.
The proportion of women in the study who are APOE4 carriers are
`0.628866`.

``` r
amyloid_df = 
  read_csv("./data_mci/mci_amyloid.csv", skip = 1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() 
```

``` r
amyloid_df = amyloid_df |> 
  pivot_longer(
    baseline:time_8,
    names_to = "observation_time",
    values_to = "years_elapsed"
  ) |> 
  filter(years_elapsed != ".") |> 
  rename(id = study_id) 
```

Steps of importing the `amyloid_df` data were to read the csv, clean the
column names, pivot the data from wide to long, filter for non-missing
values, and rename `study_id` to `id` so it can be merged with
`new_baseline`.

The `new_baseline` data has fewer subjects than in the `amyloid_df`
data, as we removed subjects who did not develop MCI from study
inclusion. The `amyloid_df` data keeps track of time (in years) elapsed
between each subject’s observations (independent of study
inclusion/exclusion).

``` r
amy_base <- inner_join(new_baseline, amyloid_df, by = "id")
```

``` r
amy_base = amy_base |> 
  transform(age_at_onset = as.numeric(age_at_onset))
```

The resulting dataset describes subjects meeting study inclusion by
study `id` and their respective `current_age`, `sex`, years of
`education`, `apoe4` carrier status, `age_at_onset` of MCI, and
`years_elapsed` at each `observation_time`.

Study participants’ average age of MCI onset is 70.4162471. Their
average number of years of education is 16.4851259. The average current
age of participants is 65.7812357.

``` r
write.csv(amy_base, "./data_mci/Combined_MCI.csv") 
```
